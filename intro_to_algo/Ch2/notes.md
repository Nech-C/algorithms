## 2.3 Designing algorithms

### 2.3.1 The divide-and-conquer approach

Divide: We divide the problem into subproblems that have the same properties as the entire problem.

Conquer: We recursively solve those subproblems. When the subproblem is small enough, we can solve them directly.

Combine: We combine the solved subproblems to form the answer to the original problem.
